    <img src="pictures/potato-pizza.jpg" class="img" alt="a picture with a pizza with potato and rosemary toppings">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Carb overkill? Maybe, but this is one of Italy's best creations.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the dough</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>500g flour '00' or plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li>400ml warm water</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp dried yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the topping</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>Potatoes</li>
      <li>Mozzarella</li>
      <li>Extra virgin oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Rosemary leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix flour, water, salt and yeast using a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). </li>
      <li>Knead until the dough comes together as a ball, and make sure it's not too sticky.</li>
      <li>Cover the dough tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place it in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls and start kneading each base.</li>
      <li>Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices, then put them in a bowl. Add extra olive oil and salt and mix them with your hands so that they are evenly coated. </li>
      <li>Add mozzarella and start layering all of your potato slices over the pizza dough.</li>
      <li>Bake at 200°C for 10-15 minutes. Finish with a garnish of fresh rosemary leaves.</li>
