    <img src="pictures/mushroom-pizza.jpg" class="img" alt="A picture with a pizza with mushroom toppings">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">A pizza margherita with a twist. Whether you make it white (no sauce) or red, mushrooms add a delicious earthy taste to it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the dough</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>500g flour '00' or plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li>400ml warm water</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp dried yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the topping</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>Mushrooms</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce (passata, optional)</li>
      <li>Extra virgin oil</li>
      <li>Dried parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Mix flour, water, salt and yeast using a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). </li>
      <li>Knead until the dough comes together as a ball, and make sure it's not too sticky.</li>
      <li>Cover the dough tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place it in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls and start kneading each base.</li>
      <li>Make the sauce (optional): Mix the passata with salt and oil. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
      <li>Cook your mushroom with olive oil and garlic in a pan. Then sprinkle the pizza base with mushrooms and mozzarella.</li>
      <li>Bake at 200°C for 10-15 minutes. Finish with a garnish of dried parsley. </li>
