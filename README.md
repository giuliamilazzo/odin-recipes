# odin-recipes
A toy page to practice some basic HTML and CSS features that I am currently learning. 
The assignment was to create a basic recipe website with at least 3 recipes (each with a link on the index page), headings, ordered and unordered lists, and images. 
I added some basic CSS styling properties as well as a few divs.
