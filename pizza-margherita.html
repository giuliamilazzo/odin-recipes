    <img src="pictures/pizza-margherita.jpg" class="img" alt="a picture of pizza margherita with tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil on top">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Legend has it that pizza margherita was invented by chef Raffaele Esposito in 1889 to honour the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy. It is now a timeless Italian dish that you can make with simple ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the dough</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>500g flour '00' or plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li>400ml warm water</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp dried yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the tomato sauce</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>Tomato sauce (passata)</li>
      <li>Extra virgin oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>For the topping</h3>
       <ul class="ingredients">
         <li>Mozzarella</li>
         <li>Basil leaves</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Mix flour, water, salt and yeast using a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). </li>
      <li>Knead until the dough comes together as a ball, and make sure it's not too sticky.</li>
      <li>Cover the dough tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place it in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls and start kneading each base.</li>
      <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata with salt and oil. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
      <li>Add mozzarella.</li>
      <li>Bake at 200°C for 10-15 minutes. Finish with a garnish of fresh basil leaves.</li>
  </ol>
